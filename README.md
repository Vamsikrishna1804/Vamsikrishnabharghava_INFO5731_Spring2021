In the final project of this course, we have performed Sentimental Analysis of Twitter Data on #USElections2022, #Bluewave, #Trump2020, #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, #Covid-19 etc.
Extracted 10000 tweets between June-2020 to Nov 3, 2020, using the Tweepy package of python.
After cleansing data, calculated the Polarities of each tweet to find out the sentiment of the text.
Applied Different Machine learning Models to the text and calculated the efficiency of each model to train the dataset.
Also calculated the impact of covid-19 on Trumpâ€™s Defeat in the elections.
