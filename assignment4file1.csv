39,"                     Introduction  Patterns in music have been the object of intensive studies in the past years. \One of the purposes of analyzing musical structure and form is to discover the patterns that are explicit or implicit in musical works"" Simon [13]. Patterns comprise periodicity, make use of alphabets, can be compound (made up of subpatterns) and possess phrase structure with various forms of punctuation. Traditionally, composers have employed pattern propagation intuitively, but algorithmic composition techniques allow the pattern propagation to be formalized, albeit a high level. During composition, all the musical patterns evolve according to the rules and constraints specied at the design stage. In jazz improvisation, the musician invents a solo guided by a progression of chords (the changes). One approach [1] to learn improvising is to memorize patterns (short chunks of music) that t sub-progressions, and to concatenate them to form a whole solo that ts a whole progression.

40,"                     Abstract Many information retrieval(IR) systems retrieve relevant documents based on exact matching of keywords between a query and documents. This method degrades precision rate. In order to solve the problem, we collected semantically related words and assigned semantic relationships used in general thesaurus and a special relationship called keyfact term(FT) manually. In addition to the semantic knowledge, we automatically constructed statistic knowledge based on the concept of mutual information. Keyfact is an extended concept of keyword represented by noun and compound noun. Keyfact can be a verb and an adjective including subject or object term. We first retrieved relevant documents with original query using tf * idf weighting formula and then an expanded query including keyfacts is used in both second document ranking and word sense disambiguating. So we made an improvement in precision rate using keyfact network. 1                   ",,Positive
